Demo: http://sandbox.321software.net/social-calc/

Toy program that demonstrates the use of WebSockets to provide a chat-like functionality.

* socketServer.php - the WebSocket server.
* im.js - the WebSocket client.

Depends on Ratchet for WebSockets and math.js for safe evaluation of mathematical expressions.
